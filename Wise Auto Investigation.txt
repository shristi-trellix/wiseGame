WISE uncovers a coordinated credential stuffing and brute force campaign.
Confidence Score: 75

Wise: “The attacker has moved beyond initial access to resource abuse and data exfiltration staging. The creation of 300 EC2 instances is a hallmark of cryptomining or botnet infrastructure. I have confirmed an active multi-cloud compromise.”
WISE pivots to infrastructure logs to confirm active post-exploitation activity.

Trellix Wise in Action
Auto investigating to find the alerts that matter.

Auto Investigation: How good is it?
What does it look like when Trellix Wise investigates an alert?
Methodology alerts are not “good” or “bad,” they must be investigated. 

Was this use of Powershell malicious?
20

Auto Investigation: Who is involved?
After analyzing the provided information, here is my assessment:
Explanation:
1. User profile: David Squiller is a Director in the Sales department, not a support account or super user. His role doesn't typically involve running PowerShell scripts or executing potentially malicious files.
2. IP profile: No specific IP address is provided for analysis.
3. Standard tools: The command executed is not a standard tool. It's a PowerShell command that downloads and executes a script from a GitHub repository, which is highly suspicious.
4. Story in the data: The most plausible story is malicious activity. A file named "19625_cutepuppyjpg.exe" (likely masquerading as an image) executed a command to run PowerShell with bypassed execution policy, downloading and executing a script from GitHub. This is a common technique used by attackers.
5. Evidence of success: The alert indicates the process was successfully created, suggesting the malicious activity was likely successful in its initial stages.
6. Importance of target: While David Squiller is not marked as a VIP, he is a Director, which makes him a potentially valuable target for attackers.
Given these factors, especially the successful execution of a suspicious PowerShell command and the target being a Director, I believe this alert should be escalated to critical severity.


Trellix Wise uses the rich context provided by integrations to understand the role of the user.

Auto Investigation: What is normal?

Trellix Wise understands what tools are normal and if they are being used suspiciously.

Trellix Wise creates a complete story based on all of the evidence.

Auto Investigation: Do we care?
After analyzing the provided information, here is my assessment:
Explanation:
1. User profile: David Squiller is a Director in the Sales department, not a support account or super user. His role doesn't typically involve running PowerShell scripts or executing potentially malicious files.
2. IP profile: No specific IP address is provided for analysis.

Deprioritizing Noisy Alerts
Trellix Wise declines to escalate this alert using a transparent decision making process.
Trellix Wise is evaluating every alert to ensure it’s not important. 

But this only works if you can audit what it’s doing.

It shows its work, walking you through its decision making process, step by step.
25

Trellix Wise fully understands the situation
Decision:
The alert was likely triggered due to the presence of a long base64 encoded string in the command line arguments of the Nessus Agent. However, this is expected behavior for this security scanning tool. The base64 string contains metadata about the system, including OS version, IP addresses, and Nessus plugin information.
Other rules that fired (like "powershell methodology [base64 string]" and "windows methodology [base64 char args]") are likely false positives triggered by the legitimate use of base64 encoding by the Nessus Agent.
Given that this appears to be normal activity from an authorized security tool, and there's no evidence of malicious intent or compromise, raising the severity to critical is not warranted. The current medium severity is appropriate, as it allows for investigation without causing undue alarm.
It knows why the alert was triggered and what it was looking for.
